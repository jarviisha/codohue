# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Codohue** is a collaborative filtering recommendation engine for the DarkVoid project. It ingests behavioral events (clicks, likes, comments, shares, skips), builds sparse vectors, and serves personalized recommendations via Qdrant vector search.

Live reload in development uses `air` (configured in `.air.toml`), auto-rebuilds `cmd/api` on Go file changes. The admin frontend lives at [web/admin/](web/admin/) (Vite + React 19 + Tailwind v4) and is embedded into the `cmd/admin` binary at build time.

## Architecture

### Four Binaries

- **`cmd/api`** — HTTP API server (port **2001**) + Redis Streams ingest worker goroutine
- **`cmd/cron`** — Batch job daemon that recomputes sparse and dense vectors plus trending data on a configurable interval (default: 5 min)
- **`cmd/admin`** — Admin server (port **2002**) that serves the embedded `web/admin` SPA, the session-cookie auth API, and the `/api/admin/v1/*` operational dashboard endpoints
- **`cmd/embedder`** — Catalog auto-embedding worker (port **2003** for `/healthz` + `/metrics`); consumes raw catalog content from per-namespace `catalog:embed:{ns}` Redis streams, embeds it via the configured `embedstrategy.Strategy`, and upserts dense vectors into `{ns}_objects_dense`. Also runs the re-embed completion watcher that closes admin-triggered batch runs when the namespace's catalog backlog drains, the recovery sweeper that re-publishes rows whose stream entry was lost, and the liveness heartbeat (`codohue:embedder:heartbeat`, TTL 90s) the admin overview reads.

### Go Workspace

The repo is a Go workspace ([go.work](go.work)) with four modules; lint/test/coverage targets iterate over every module:

| Module                   | Purpose                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.`                      | Server application — all four binaries, all `internal/` domains, e2e suite           |
| `./pkg/codohuetypes`     | Shared wire types so SDK consumers do not pull in pgx/qdrant/prometheus dependencies |
| `./sdk/go`               | Public Go SDK for clients embedding Codohue                                          |
| `./sdk/go/redistream`    | Redis Streams transport helper for the SDK                                           |

                                               Recommend Service (hybrid dense path)
```

### Domain Organization

Each feature domain lives in `internal/<domain>/` with a consistent `handler.go`, `service.go`, `repository.go`, `types.go` structure:

| Domain            | Responsibility                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ingest`               | HTTP and Redis Streams event ingestion — validates events, stores to `events` table                              |
| `compute`              | Batch recomputes sparse + dense vectors with time decay, upserts to Qdrant; logs to `batch_run_logs`              |
| `recommend`            | Serves CF recommendations, hybrid dense/sparse, trending, rank, BYOE embeddings, object deletion                  |
| `nsconfig`             | CRUD for per-namespace configuration (action weights, decay params, dense hybrid config, catalog config)          |
| `admin`                | Handlers, services, and repositories for the `cmd/admin` operational dashboard                                    |
| `catalog`              | Data-plane HTTP ingest path for raw catalog content; persists `catalog_items` and publishes to embed streams      |
| `objects`              | Per-object metadata independent of embedding (currently author attribution); the `objects` table, usable under every `dense_source` |
| `embedder`             | Per-item embed pipeline (load → embed → upsert dense vector → mark embedded), worker, re-embed completion watcher |
| `auth`                 | Bearer token validation — global admin key and per-namespace bcrypt-hashed keys                                   |
| `config`               | Loads and validates application configuration from environment variables                                          |
| `core/embedstrategy`   | Forward-compat seam for embedding strategies — `Strategy` interface + registry; both `catalog` and `embedder` depend on it (and never on each other) |
| `core/namespace`       | Shared namespace configuration contracts (`namespace.Config`) consumed by every domain                            |
| `core/idmap`           | Maps string IDs → numeric Qdrant point IDs via `id_mappings` table                                                |
| `core/httpapi`         | Shared JSON HTTP response helpers and middleware                                                                  |
| `architecture`         | Repository architecture tests — enforces the import rule below                                                    |

**Import rule** (enforced by [internal/architecture/imports_test.go](internal/architecture/imports_test.go)): packages under `internal/` may only import `internal/config`, `internal/core/...`, `internal/infra/...`, and their own subpackages (e.g. `internal/admin` may import `internal/admin/sse`). Peer-domain imports are forbidden. Cross-domain coordination happens through `cmd/api` and `cmd/admin` wiring (e.g. [cmd/admin/nsconfig_adapter.go](cmd/admin/nsconfig_adapter.go)).

### Infrastructure Clients (`internal/infra/`)

- `postgres/db.go` — pgxpool connection
- `redis/client.go` — go-redis client (Streams + trending ZSET)
- `qdrant/client.go` — Qdrant gRPC client
- `metrics/metrics.go` — Prometheus counters/histograms; exposed at `GET /metrics`

### Batch Job Phases

The cron binary runs three phases per namespace on each tick:

| Phase | Name     | Description                                                                           |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Sparse   | Recomputes CF sparse vectors and upserts to `{ns}_subjects` / `{ns}_objects` Qdrant collections |
| 2     | Dense    | Derives user embeddings by mean-pooling the dense vectors of each subject's interacted items and upserts them to `{ns}_subjects_dense`. Where the item vectors come from depends on `dense_source`: `"item2vec"` / `"svd"` train them here and also upsert to `{ns}_objects_dense`; `"catalog"` reads them back from `{ns}_objects_dense` (owned by `cmd/embedder`) and writes **only** subject vectors. Skipped for `"byoe"` and `"disabled"` |
| 3     | Trending | Computes time-decayed trending scores from recent events and caches them in Redis ZSET. Skipped when Redis is unavailable |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Full recompute strategy**: The cron job recalculates all vectors from scratch each run to avoid incremental update race conditions. No get→merge→upsert pattern. Item2Vec retrains fully each run — incremental online Word2Vec is deliberately avoided because it causes catastrophic forgetting.
- **ID mapping via DB**: String IDs map to numeric Qdrant point IDs through the `id_mappings` table (BIGSERIAL), avoiding hash collisions.
- **Sparse vectors**: `{ns}_subjects` and `{ns}_objects` Qdrant collections hold sparse interaction vectors (dot product similarity).
- **Dense source (unified)**: a single `dense_source` enum names the producer of object dense vectors — `disabled` | `item2vec` | `svd` | `byoe` | `catalog`. It replaced the old `dense_strategy` + `catalog_enabled` pair (added in 016 with a dual-write window; the legacy columns were dropped in 017). `{ns}_subjects_dense` / `{ns}_objects_dense` hold the dense embeddings. When `alpha < 1.0` and `dense_source != "disabled"`, the recommend service blends sparse CF scores (weight=`alpha`) with dense scores (weight=`1-alpha`) using min-max normalization before merging. Selecting `catalog` is how catalog auto-embedding is enabled — there is no separate boolean, so the old dense_strategy↔catalog conflict is structurally impossible.
- **`dense_source` names the producer of *object* vectors only**: `{ns}_subjects_dense` is a separate question. Nothing but `cmd/cron` phase 2 mean-pooling fills it (BYOE aside), which is why phase 2 runs under `catalog` too — otherwise the embedder would fill `{ns}_objects_dense` while `{ns}_subjects_dense` stayed empty, `fetchSubjectDenseVector` would return nil, and every request would silently fall back to pure sparse CF with the catalog embeddings never read. Under `catalog` the phase loads only the item vectors for objects that actually appear in events (`interactedObjectIDs` → `FetchItemDenseVectors`), since only those can contribute to a subject's mean.
- **Author is ownership metadata, never a behavioural link**: `objects.author_subject_id` records which subject *created* an object. It shares the id space of `events.subject_id` but has no foreign key, and the only thing that ever reads it is the opt-in `exclude_authored` filter below — never the embedder, never `cmd/cron`, and never as a scoring signal. The subject↔object relation that drives CF lives solely in `events` and is **many-to-many**: the whole signal is that many subjects touch the same object. Giving an object one owning subject would not model that relation, it would destroy it.
- **`objects` vs `catalog_items`**: `catalog_items` is embedding input and its lifecycle (content, hash, state machine, strategy). `objects` is facts about the object itself. Author started on `catalog_items` (019) and moved out in 021 because that table only exists for `dense_source="catalog"` — under `item2vec`/`svd`/`byoe` an object has no row anywhere, so attribution had no home and `exclude_authored` silently did nothing. The column was **moved, not copied**: two stores for one fact drift apart, the failure mode 016/017 removed when `dense_strategy` and `catalog_enabled` could disagree. Catalog ingest still accepts `author_subject_id` and writes it through to `objects` via an interface injected in `cmd/api`, so `internal/catalog` never imports the peer domain. Absence on a catalog re-ingest means "unspecified" and leaves the attribution alone; an explicit empty value on `PUT /objects/{id}` clears it.
- **Excluding a subject's own objects** (`exclude_authored`, default off): the exclusion is materialised as point ids and merged into the same Qdrant `MustNot` that already carries seen-items, so one filter covers the sparse (`{ns}_objects`) and dense (`{ns}_objects_dense`) collections alike. Filtering on a Qdrant payload field instead would only reach the dense collection — `cmd/cron` writes the sparse points and knows nothing about authorship — so the feature would silently do nothing in the most common configuration. The trending and popular fallbacks cannot push the filter into the store, so they over-fetch by the exclusion size and drop authored ids *before* paging; filtering after paging would make the offset count rows that are about to disappear. Cost of the id approach: the filter grows with the number of objects the requesting subject authored, capped at `authoredObjectsCap` (5000) with a warning log when it bites. A query failure degrades to unfiltered results rather than failing the request.
- **Namespace config writes are PATCH, not replace**: every field on `nsconfig.UpsertRequest` is a pointer, and nil travels all the way to SQL where `COALESCE($n, column)` keeps the current value. This is why the write is two statements (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to seed schema defaults for a new row, then `UPDATE ... COALESCE`) rather than one `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`: the conflict form must supply a value for every column, so a request naming one field reset all the others to their Go zero value — and the admin UI submits only the fields the operator edited. `dense_source` is named explicitly on the INSERT because the app default for a new namespace (`disabled`) differs from the schema default (`item2vec`).
- **Time decay**: Events older than 90 days excluded. Freshness multiplier `e^(-λ × days_since)` applied during vector build; γ-based object freshness applied at rerank time.
- **Cold start**: 0 interactions → Redis trending ZSET (fallback to DB popular); <5 interactions → 70% trending + 30% CF hybrid.
- **Recommendation cache**: Results cached in Redis for 5 minutes per `(namespace, subject_id, limit)` key.
- **Two-tier auth**: Global `CODOHUE_ADMIN_API_KEY` is used by the admin server (`cmd/admin`) for session creation and is **not** accepted by the data plane for mutations — namespace configuration lives only on the admin plane. Per-namespace bcrypt-hashed keys (stored in `namespace_configs.api_key_hash`) authenticate data-plane requests. The global key is a fallback **only while a namespace has no key provisioned** — once a key exists, the data plane rejects the global key, so provisioning narrows the blast radius of an admin-key leak. A leaked namespace key is rotated via `POST /api/admin/v1/namespaces/{ns}/api-key` (plaintext returned once). All plain-string credential compares are constant-time; the public admin login endpoint is per-IP rate-limited; repeated bad data-plane tokens hit a 30s negative cache instead of a bcrypt compare each time. Admin sessions are HMAC JWTs signed with an independent secret (`CODOHUE_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`, or fresh random material each boot), carry a `jti`, and logout revokes the token server-side.
- **Locked client wire contract**: The client-facing JSON types live once in `pkg/codohuetypes` and are re-exported into the server domains via type aliases (e.g. `type Response = codohuetypes.Response`), so the server marshals the exact struct the SDK unmarshals. Request bodies are decoded with `httpapi.DecodeStrict` (rejects unknown fields + trailing data → 400), so client typos fail loudly instead of being silently dropped — a redundant `namespace` in the rankings/catalog body is rejected (the URL path is authoritative; `events` still carries `namespace` because the Redis-stream transport needs it). The marshaled shape of every wire type is pinned by golden snapshots in `pkg/codohuetypes/testdata/` (see the wire-contract convention below).

### REST API — `cmd/api` (port 2001)

**Infra / ops (no auth, unversioned)**

| Method  | Path       | Description                              |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `GET`   | `/ping`    | Liveness probe                           |
| `GET`   | `/healthz` | Health check for postgres, redis, qdrant |
| `GET`   | `/metrics` | Prometheus metrics                       |

**Client-facing — per-namespace Bearer token (falls back to `CODOHUE_ADMIN_API_KEY`)**

Every business capability is reachable from exactly one canonical path. Legacy duplicate paths have been removed and return 404.

| Method   | Path                                                                    | Description                                                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST`   | `/v1/namespaces/{ns}/events`                                            | Ingest a behavioral event (202 Accepted + `{"event_id":N}`; namespace in body is ignored). Also fans the event onto the `codohue:events-tail:{ns}` pub/sub channel for the admin live tail. |
| `POST`   | `/v1/namespaces/{ns}/catalog`                                           | Ingest raw content for catalog auto-embedding (202; only when `dense_source="catalog"`; embedder consumer asynchronously upserts the dense vector). Optional `author_subject_id` is written through to the `objects` table (not stored on `catalog_items`); omitting it leaves any existing attribution alone |
| `GET`    | `/v1/namespaces/{ns}/subjects/{id}/recommendations`                     | CF recommendations for a subject (`?limit=&offset=`)                   |
| `POST`   | `/v1/namespaces/{ns}/rankings`                                          | Score and rank up to 500 candidate items for a subject (200, computed) |
| `GET`    | `/v1/namespaces/{ns}/trending`                                          | Trending items from Redis ZSET (`?limit=&offset=`); `window_hours` in the response reports the namespace's configured window (a request param would be a lie — there is one ZSET per namespace) |
| `PUT`    | `/v1/namespaces/{ns}/objects/{id}`                                      | Store per-object metadata — currently `author_subject_id` (idempotent, 200). Accepted for **every** `dense_source`; an empty author clears the attribution |
| `PUT`    | `/v1/namespaces/{ns}/objects/{id}/embedding`                            | Store/replace BYOE dense vector for an object (idempotent, 204). Optional `object_created_at` in the body feeds the γ-freshness rerank. Returns **409 Conflict** when the namespace has `dense_source="catalog"` (catalog auto-embedding is the source of truth in that mode). |
| `PUT`    | `/v1/namespaces/{ns}/subjects/{id}/embedding`                           | Store/replace BYOE dense vector for a subject (idempotent, 204). NOT guarded by catalog mode — unlike object vectors, subject vectors have no single owner: `cmd/cron` phase 2 mean-pools them on every tick, and this endpoint lets a client overwrite one between ticks to cut staleness. |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/namespaces/{ns}/objects/{id}`                                      | Remove an object from all Qdrant collections **and drop its `objects` metadata row** (idempotent, 204). Deleting a *catalog item* from the admin plane does not — that removes embedding input, not the object |

> **Ingest transport options:** Events can be sent via the HTTP endpoint above **or** published directly to Redis Streams — the `ingest` worker consumes both paths and writes to the same `events` table. The Redis Streams transport carries `namespace` inside the payload because it has no URL path.

### REST API — `cmd/admin` (port 2002, session-cookie auth via `codohue_admin_session`)

Authentication models sessions as a resource. Login = create session; logout = delete current session.

The admin API is designed for a monitoring UI, not plain REST CRUD: it exposes **aggregate** endpoints (one payload per view), **SSE streams** (`text/event-stream`, `event: <kind>` frames, `event: ping` heartbeat, `X-Accel-Buffering: no`), and **lifecycle** endpoints for batch runs. SSE rows are marked **(SSE)** below.

| Method   | Path                                                                | Auth          | Description                                                             |

### Database Schema

Migrations live in `migrations/` as `NNN_name.up.sql` / `NNN_name.down.sql` pairs. Core tables from `001_initial.up.sql`:

- `namespace_configs` — per-namespace config (action weights, decay params, dense hybrid settings, `api_key_hash`)
- `events` — raw behavioral events; indexed on `(namespace, subject_id)` and `occurred_at`
- `id_mappings` — string ID → BIGSERIAL numeric ID, scoped by `(namespace, entity_type)`

Key columns added by later migrations:

- **002** — `gamma` on namespace_configs (γ-based object freshness rerank)
- **003** — `seen_items_days` on namespace_configs (recency window for the seen-items filter)
- **004** — `object_created_at` on events
- **005** — `api_key_hash`, `alpha`, `dense_strategy`, `embedding_dim`, `trending_*` on namespace_configs
- **006** — `batch_run_logs` table (per-run history written by `cmd/cron` and surfaced by the admin API)
- **007** — phase breakdown columns on `batch_run_logs` (`phase{1,2,3}_ok` / `_duration_ms` / `_subjects` / `_objects` / `_error`)
- **008** — `trigger_source` on `batch_run_logs` (e.g. `cron`, `admin`)
- **009** — `log_lines` JSONB on `batch_run_logs` (captured slog output for run inspection)
- **010** — `catalog_items` table (raw content store consumed by `cmd/embedder`)
- **011** — `catalog_enabled`, `catalog_strategy_id`, `catalog_strategy_version`, `catalog_strategy_params` on `namespace_configs`
- **012** — pre-prod hardening of `batch_run_logs`: `trigger_source` CHECK-constrained to `('cron', 'manual', 'admin_reembed')`; adds `target_strategy_id` / `target_strategy_version` for catalog re-embed runs; renames `subjects_processed` → `entities_processed` (column now carries CF subject counts during cron runs and catalog item counts during re-embed runs)
- **013** — `cancel_requested` on `batch_run_logs` + partial index `idx_batch_run_logs_running_cancel` for operator-initiated cancel between phases
- **014** — `catalog_backlog_samples` table for the persisted backlog timeline (one row per ns per 30s sampler tick, skip-on-unchanged)
- **015** — indexes on `batch_run_logs.started_at` + `catalog_backlog_samples.sampled_at` to support the cron retention prune (`CODOHUE_BATCH_RUN_RETENTION_DAYS` / `CODOHUE_BACKLOG_SAMPLES_RETENTION_DAYS`)
- **016** — `dense_source` on namespace_configs (single producer enum: `disabled`/`item2vec`/`svd`/`byoe`/`catalog`), backfilled from `catalog_enabled`/`dense_strategy` + CHECK constraint; legacy columns kept for the dual-write window
- **017** — drops the legacy `dense_strategy` + `catalog_enabled` columns; `dense_source` is the single source of truth (down recreates + backfills them, mapping `catalog` → `disabled` + `catalog_enabled=TRUE`)
- **018** — `idx_events_ns_subject_occurred` on `events (namespace, subject_id, occurred_at DESC)` so the admin subject browser aggregates via index-only scan
- **019** — `author_subject_id` on `catalog_items` + partial index `idx_catalog_items_ns_author` (attributed rows only); nullable, no FK
- **020** — `exclude_authored` on namespace_configs (default FALSE) — opt-in filter dropping a subject's own authored objects from their recommendations
- **021** — `objects` table (`namespace`, `object_id`, `author_subject_id`) + partial index; **moves** `author_subject_id` off `catalog_items` and drops that column, so attribution works under every `dense_source`
- **022** — re-keys `id_mappings` on `PRIMARY KEY (namespace, entity_type, string_id)` (was a global `string_id` PK that let two namespaces — or a subject and an object — share one row); run a full recompute per namespace after deploying so Qdrant points use the newly minted numeric ids

## Conventions

### Package documentation

Every package must have a `docs.go` file containing only the `// Package <name> ...` comment and the `package` declaration. This is the canonical place to describe what the package does — do not scatter package-level explanations across other files.

```go
// Package ingest consumes behavioral events from Redis Streams,
// validates them, and persists them to the events table in PostgreSQL.
package ingest
```

### Comments language

All code comments (inline comments, doc comments, TODO notes) must be written in **English**. This applies to every `.go` file in the repository without exception.

### Test files

Every file that contains business logic (`service.go`, `repository.go`, `job.go`, `worker.go`) must have a corresponding `_test.go` file. Handler tests live in `handler_test.go`. Files that only declare types (`types.go`) or wire dependencies (`docs.go`) do not require test files.

### Wire contract (`pkg/codohuetypes`)

The client-facing JSON types are the public contract — treat changes to them as breaking. Any rename, removal, retype, or json-tag change is caught by the golden snapshots in [pkg/codohuetypes/golden_test.go](pkg/codohuetypes/golden_test.go) (one `testdata/*.golden.json` per type). After a **deliberate** contract change, regenerate and commit the snapshots so the diff is reviewed:

```bash
go test ./pkg/codohuetypes/... -run Golden -update
```

When adding a new client-facing wire type, add a case to that test (the orphan guard fails if a snapshot has no matching case). New request fields on existing types must be added to the struct in `codohuetypes` — `httpapi.DecodeStrict` rejects anything not declared there.

### Commit messages

Commit messages describe **what changed and what was added** in repo terms (files, functions, behaviour). Format:

```
type(scope): subject (≤72 chars)

Brief body (2–4 lines max). What the change does, not narrative.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Rules:

- Subject line follows Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `style`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`).
- **Never reference internal/transient concepts** like "Phase 5", "Tier 1", "Step 2", `T012`, plan/spec task numbers. Reviewers reading `git log` six months later don't have that context — describe the code change in code terms.
- Skip per-file enumeration — the diff already has it.
- Skip trailing "Verified npm run build…" stanzas unless a test result is genuinely surprising and worth recording.
- One paragraph of context maximum. "X had problem Y; this does Z." in one line is usually enough.
